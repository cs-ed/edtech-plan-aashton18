# Educational Technology Plan

## School Site & Program Overview
Serving grades 6-8, Riverside Meadows Intermediate School is the first K-12 school within Yuba County to bring a fully developed Computer Science (CS) program to students. According to a 2019 csforall.org report, only 0.9% of Yuba County students were enrolled in computer science-related classes.  This represents a mere 34 students in the county.  Understanding that high-tech industries produce nearly ¼ of the country’s economic output and computing occupations are the fastest-growing career field, Plumas Lake Elementary School District is working to pilot a new elective program to excite interest in CS beginning in the middle school grades. In addition, it aims to influence the feeder High School into developing their own CS program to include offering an AP Computer Science course.  

After complete development of the program at the middle school level, the District’s long-term plan is to trickle down the instruction of CS concepts through STEM activities with our K-5 schools by adding a special class (in conjunction with our PE and VAPA programs). In addition, the summer school session provides an opportunity to reach younger students, entice interest in the middle school’s computer science program, and vet future course offerings at the upper level. This initiative is a collaborative effort between Plumas Lake Elementary School District’s superintendent, the middle school principal, and myself.

### Impacts & Challenges of Computer Science Education
In the education profession, instilling 21st Century Literacy Skills in students has been touted as an educational priority. But, what are these skills, why are they important, and how prepared are educators to teach them?  Moving beyond reading and writing instruction, which forms traditional literacy, students must now be able to use scientific reasoning, be multicultural aware, and use critical thinking to succeed in today's high-tech environment.  Computer science, which develops a student's ability to computational think, persevere, and create, is an excellent way to develop those necessary 21st Century Literacy requirements.  The challenge, however, is gaining the critics' support and finding enough qualified educators to bring this subject to the forefront of the school system.

The world has transitioned to become more and more reliant on technology and the internet.  As this reliance grows, the job market has followed in this transition.  In fact, "already over 90 percent of jobs that humans used to do in the past have been taken over by computers" (Balakrishnan, 2018). "Advances in computer processing power and internet connectivity mean that our service sector is affected ... travel agents, bankers, sales assistants, and even doctors and lawyers are seeing the tasks they used to perform replaced by programs and machines which do their jobs faster, cheaper and sometimes more accurately.  The scale of this challenge is enormous. Economists Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osbourne predict that 47% of existing jobs are under threat from automation" (Chalmers & Watts, 2014).  Educators are tasked to provide the necessary skills to help their students succeed in their future careers.  This means that this profession needs to be more cognizant of what those future careers look like.  As computers have taken dominance, it is time to revitalize the curriculum to support the future within this changing marketplace.

Teaching computer science is more about preparing students to work within a growing technical world. It is a subject that teaches them how to use logic, to create, and to persevere: "Logic, problem-solving, and organization are some of the cornerstones of programming, and practicing with code helps you exercise that "left" side of the brain. According to Leong, "Learning to code has not only helped me process the rationale behind my thinking but has increased my ability to create more well-thought-out decisions through organizing my thoughts and intentions" (Balakrishnan, 2018). Of course, not all students will continue to be computer programmers.  The skills learned from computer science, however, will benefit all students in their future pursuits due to its ability to instill "the abilities to abstract, compartmentalize and synthesize [which] can be transferred to any domain" (Chalmers & Watts, 2014).

Although the benefits of computer science in the development of students' 21st Century Literacy Skills can be easily supported, teaching computer science within the K-12 school system does have its critics.  Some have claimed that the push from the technology industry is a way to force their products' sales onto school districts.  One-to-one devices, educational software programs, and internet setups all add high costs to these schools, which line silicon valley’s industry pockets.  Some have argued that instead of this technology benefiting the student, it has had quite the opposite effect: "If you want to see the connection between declining academic achievement in American schools, look no further than the encroachment of computers into the classroom. As computers have increased, scores have declined" (Dvorak, 2012).  Others have argued that additional screen time with a generation that already spends too much time on phones, iPads, and computer games undermines children's physical health.  Does the addition of computer science within K-12 education support the growth of the whole child?

Despite the critics, many see the need to support students' growth in computational thinking.  The problem school districts find, however, is the lack of qualified educators to deliver this instruction. "It is difficult to find qualified teachers because California does not offer a computer science teaching credential. We do not have people with the knowledge to teach those classes, nor are those people showing up when we are looking for them," San Jose Unified curriculum director Jackie Zeller said. Hiring a teacher means letting someone else go. However, tenured teachers are owed a job, even if their specialized course disappears" (Noguchi, 2014, 3).  In addition to lacking qualified instructors, the subject of computer science, which is currently not a required subject for college entrance, must compete with subjects that are: "Because computer science is not required for entrance to public universities, it must compete for enrollment with band, art and other electives that students may be reluctant to give up" (Noguchi, 2014, 3). In addition, students preparing for entry into a California University must take two years of a foreign language and one year of a Visual and Performing Arts course.  With limited years to prepare for college entrance, it is no wonder that students are not prioritizing computer science with these mandated requirements.

The need for a future generation of citizens in computational thinking is clear. Unfortunately, the United States currently has a shortage of qualified laborers, and this need will only grow as society becomes more reliant on computers in all facets of life.  The pressure to teach computer science is starting to surface, but school districts are struggling to afford the cost of implementation and finding qualified staff to lead this instruction. In addition, universities, the driving forces behind what is taught in High Schools, have not revamped their entrance requirements to support this transition.  Without more public attention and support on this necessary change within our schools, the United States will likely continue to be challenged in this area.
